# Raspberry Pi JonesFORTH O/S

Derived from [pijFORTHos], in turn based on [_Jonesforth-ARM_](https://github.com/M2IHP13-admin/JonesForth-arm).

_Jonesforth-ARM_ is an ARM port, by M2IHP'13 class members listed in `AUTHORS`, of _x86 JonesForth_. Much of the bare metal code
was modified from [dwelch67]'s excellent bare metal tutorials.

The major difference with pijFORTHos is a really minimal ASM kernel (just 3k), and no C code. The kernel does *just* enough to bootstrap FORTH. 

## Instructions

On an RPi you can just do

	make clean ; make

Then copy kernel.img, start.elf, bootload.bin to a blank FAT32 formatted SD card.

Everything that works in pijFORTHos should also work here. But note that the
bootloader can be called with UPLOAD, but expects a hex dump of the kernel.
The makefile generates this as kernel.hex. 
You can simply paste (Ctrl-a Ctrl-y in Minicom) in after entering UPLOAD and the kernel will be transferred. 
BOOT will start the new kernel and reload it. 

As in pijFORTHos, you can connect over serial with the port settings 115200-8-N-1. If you use minicom, the supplied
script hex.scr recompiles, and then uses the bootloader to upload the new kernel and reboots. Configure minicom to use
ANSI color, as minFORTH use ANSI codes to display colored text, clear the screen etc.

## Running
If you connect via the UART and boot the board, you should see:

    <PRESS ENTER>
    
press enter and you will see:

Original pijFORTHos documentation:

pijFORTHos

_x86 JonesForth_ is a Linux-hosted FORTH presented in a Literate Programming style
by Richard W.M. Jones <rich@annexia.org> originally at <http://annexia.org/forth>.
Comments embedded in the original provide an excellent FORTH implementation tutorial.
See the `/annexia/` directory for a copy of this original source.

The algorithm for our unsigned DIVMOD instruction is extracted from 'ARM
Software Development Toolkit User Guide v2.50' published by ARM in 1997-1998

Firmware files to make bootable images are maintained at <https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware>.
See the `/firmware/` directory for local copies used in the build process.


## What is this ?

_pijFORTHos_ is a bare-metal FORTH interpreter for the Raspberry Pi.
It follows the general strategy given by David Welch's
[excellent examples](https://github.com/dwelch67/raspberrypi).
A simple [bootloader](/doc/bootload.md#bootloader) is built in,
supporting XMODEM uploads of new bare-metal kernel images.

The interpreter uses the RPi serial console (115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit).
If you have _pijFORTHos_ on an SD card in the RPi,
you can connect it to another machine (even another RPi)
using a [USB-to-Serial cable](http://www.adafruit.com/products/954).
When the RPi is powered on (I provide power through the cable),
a terminal program on the host machine allows access to the FORTH console.


## Build and run instructions

If you are building on the RPi, just type:

    $ make clean all

If you can't compile (or cross-compile) from source,
you can use the pre-built `kernel.img` file.

Next, copy the firmware and kernel to a blank SD card, for example:

    $ cp firmware/* /media/<SD-card>/
    $ cp kernel.img /media/<SD-card>/

The end state for the SD card is to have a FAT32 filesystem on it with the following files:

    bootcode.bin
    start.elf
    kernel.img

Put the prepared SD card into the RPi,
connect the USB-to-Serial cable
(see [RPi Serial Connection](http://elinux.org/RPi_Serial_Connection) for more details),
and power-up to the console.

To get to the console, you'll need to connect. Here are two ways to try:

    $ minicom -b 115200 -o -D <device>

Where `<device>` is something like `/dev/ttyUSB0` or similar
(wherever you plugged in your USB-to-Serial cable).

Alternatively, if `minicom` is not working for you, try using `screen`:

    $ screen <device> 115200

Where `<device>` is, again, something like `/dev/ttyUSB0`.

The console will be waiting for an input, press `<ENTER>`. You should then see:

    pijFORTHos <version> sp=0x00008000


## Where to go from HERE ?

With FORTH REPL running, try typing:

    HEX 8000 DECIMAL 128 DUMP

You should see something like:
